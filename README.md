  - 1.03_Boston Housing - XGBoost - Low Level
    - Building a model using SageMaker
    - Low level approach where we describe different tasks we want SageMaker to perform
    - The high level approach makes developing new models very straightforward, requiring very little code. The reason this can be done is that certain decisions have been made for you. 
    - The low level approach allows you to be far more particular in how you want the various tasks executed, which is good for when you want to do something a little more complicated.

  - 1.05_Boston Housing - XGBoost (Deploy) - Low Level
    - Building and Deploying simple model with the low level approach
    - The low level approach allows you to be far more particular in how you want the various tasks executed, which is good for when you want to do something a little more complicated.
